# Challenge 4: Data Integration and Analytical Queries

**Tasks:** 
1. Analogous to the other workbook (Challenge 3). 
2. Again, please put your SQL commands in code blocks. Be careful that long queries are not cut off at the right border of the page.


## Title

*Please, again write your project title (as in the previous workbook) here). If you want to change your title, write here the old and the new title.

Bundestag Election Data Warehouse: Politische Stimmungs- und Ergebnisdatenbank


## Data Transformation
*How did you perform your data transformation? Fill out the following list with short answers and optionally one example SQL query each. Which tasks were necessary for your project? Why? Why not? How did you do it? Write at least one SQL query here. (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 1)*

* Checking data quality and fixing data errors:

**Duplicate detection:** Determine unique constraint columns and find duplicates using ```sql GROUP BY``` or ```sql WITH INVALID UNIQUE``` or ```sql OVER (PARTITION BY ...)```. For example:

```sql
SELECT * WITH INVALID UNIQUE (SHORTNAME) FROM ST_META_BUNDESTAG_PARTIES;
```

All queries: [duplicates_st_meta_bundestag_districts.sql](https://github.com/noahjutz-2026-sose/practice/blob/0891c10747405181a5e6485fd12577a7383198cc/DW/challenges/ch4_import/duplicates/duplicates_st_meta_bundestag_districts.sql), [duplicates.sql](https://github.com/noahjutz-2026-sose/practice/blob/0891c10747405181a5e6485fd12577a7383198cc/DW/challenges/ch4_import/duplicates/duplicates.sql).

* Harmonization / Normalization: 🖊️

* Deduplication: 🖊️

* Fuzzy entity matching (Levensthein, Soundex, ...): 🖊️

* Data Fusion (merge multiple rows into one target row): 🖊️


## Data Integration
*Write down a MERGE command to integrate data from your staging area into your target data-warehouse schema: (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 2)*

```sql
🖊️ 
```

## Analytical Queries
*Write 7 SQL queries here. These can be your query ideas from your presentation (Challenge 1), but can also be other queries. Write at least one query with `GROUPING SETS` (or `ROLLUP` or `CUBE`) , one with a window function (no ranking), one with a ranking function, one with a statistical function (e.g., `STDEV_POP`), and one skyline query. Start each query with a comment that describes the query. (Ex. Sheet 6)*

```sql
-- Query 1: GROUPING SETS / ROLLUP / CUBE
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 2: Window Function (no ranking) 
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 3: Window Function (ranking query)
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 4: Statistical Function
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 5: Skyline Query
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 6: 
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
```sql
-- Query 7: 
-- 🖊️ 
SELECT 🖊️ 
```
